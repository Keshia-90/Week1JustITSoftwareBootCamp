    <h2>Cane Corso</h2>
    <p style="background-color:crimson; color: aqua; border-style: dashed; ;border-color: black; font-family: cursive;" >Cane Corso's are an Italian breed of mastiff. The name of this breed of dog roughly translates from Latin as 'bodyguard dog', which is one of the reasons they are usually kept, aswell as for companionship. <br> As this breed can grow to be a 110lb energetic adult, ensuring the cane corso is appropriately socialised and taught basic skills, from being a puppy, will allow them to learn important behaviours so that they can be successful in adulthood.<br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cane_Corso" target="_blank">Further information regarding cane corso</a> </p>

    <h3>Pitbull</h3>
    <p style= "background-color: blueviolet; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; border: 9px; border-style: double;">Pitbull is not a specific dog breed, but an umbrella term which is used for several breeds which are often referred to as "bully breeds". These types of dogs are often misunderstood due to people using them for dog fighting rings. <br> Like the cane corso it is essential that their owner invests time to train, socialise and provide consistent firm guidance.</p>
